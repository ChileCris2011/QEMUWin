# QEMUWin
### A simple GUI for QEMU in Windows based in Python
   
QEMU is known for its versatility in creating virtual machines, especially on Linux. However, it's also a viable option on Windows for creating virtual machines with specific hardware.   

On Linux, [virt-manager](https://github.com/virt-manager/virt-manager) is the most popular option for managing VMs, offering an intuitive and easy-to-use GUI. However, Windows lacks this feature, making QEMU primarily an option for advanced users... until now.   
   
QEMUWin *will be* a new, simple-to-use Python-based interface for Windows that promises to bring virt-manager features to Windows.

### RC GUI v1:

We're finally reaching the final interface. RC GUI v1 brings several changes to VM creation/editing, the error window, logs, and much more. We're getting closer to our goal.

This release can be used normally (*although I wouldn't recommend it yet*). The application's executable can be found in the [Releases](https://github.com/ChileCris2011/QEMUWin/releases) tab. Remember that you must have [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/download/#windows) installed on your system.
