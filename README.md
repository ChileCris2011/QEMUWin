# QEMUWin
### A simple GUI for QEMU in Windows based in Python
   
QEMU is known for its versatility in creating virtual machines, especially on Linux. However, it's also a viable option on Windows for creating virtual machines with specific hardware.   

On Linux, [virt-manager](https://github.com/virt-manager/virt-manager) is the most popular option for managing VMs, offering an intuitive and easy-to-use GUI. However, Windows lacks this feature, making QEMU primarily an option for advanced users... until now.   
   
QEMUWin *will be* a new, simple-to-use Python-based interface for Windows that promises to bring virt-manager features to Windows.

### Beta GUI v1:

I'm happy to see that all my effort is giving results. This is the first release of the real GUI and, even with all it's bugs, I'm proud to see results off of my work.   
   
Just like the previous release, this version isn't intended for general use yet. It contains too many bugs (most of which I probably don't even know about)!  
Since I don't think this version(s) will be available for very long, I won't write the user guide until I have the first stable version.
